All compulsory features have been implemented:

1. Modify the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a parabolic path. When the ball hits the horizontal ground, it should bounce off the ground.
2. Introduce collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet hits it. After a collision, you can make the bullet disappear too.
3. Introduce collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.

Following extra features have been implemented:

i.   Use bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubbles, they should split into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions.
ii.  Add a score, time and a health counter. The score increases whenever you hit a bubble. The game gets over when we run out of time (measured in seconds) or if we run out of health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).
iii. Daughter bubbles are of different colour from the parent bubble.
iv.  Player scores double the points for hitting a daughter bubble than he would do for hitting a parent bubble.
v.   Player gets a 30 second timer and 3 "lives" before he can finish the game.
vi.  Special messages displaying victory or loss at the end of the game.
